Subject: [Kedr-devel] [Bug #17591] different binary and source version of
	the linux kernel
Message-ID: <201104120856.p3C8uZtL013993@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #17591, was updated on 2010-Oct-11 17:27

Summary: different binary and source version of the linux kernel

Details: The binary version of my linux kernel is 2.6.31.5-0.1-desktop (uname -r output), but the version of installed kernel sources is 2.6.31.14-0.1. So, the example ./share/kedr/examples/sample_target/ cannot be built because of the following errors:

make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.31.5-0.1-desktop/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.

My system has /usr/src/linux-2.6.31.14-0.1 directory instead of /lib/modules/2.6.31.5-0.1-desktop and is not provide lower versions of kernel sources in the official software repository.

Comment:
By default, KEDR is built  against version of the kernel, which is currently running. User should provide by himself existence of infrastructure for build kernel modules in '/lib/modules/<current-kernel-version>/build'.

Possibility to build KEDR against arbitrary kernel version is introduce now in experimental mode. For use it, one should set KBUILD_VERSION_STRING cmake-variable to the version of the preferred kernel when configuring KEDR.
Again, infrastructure for build kernel modules should be accessible via '/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/build'.

Summary: Leak checker need to intercept more functions

Details: 'nfs' kernel module uses at least next functions, which internally call alloc/free-like functions:

add_to_page_cache ~ free
posix_acl_from_mode ~ alloc
match_strdup ~ alloc

Without interception and making model of these functions, leak checker cannot produce correct verdict about memory allocations/deallocation.

Comment:
Starting from version 0.2.1, KEDR supports cross-builds. Among other things, building for a different kernel version on the same machine or at least the machine with the same architecture is now supported.
