Subject: [Kedr-devel] [Bug #17596] start, stop and start again failure
Message-ID: <201102241403.p1OE3KOI017373@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #17596, was updated on 2010-Oct-12 18:39
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: KEDR
Category: None
Status: Closed
Resolution: Works For Me
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: andrey86
Assigned to : none
Summary: start, stop and start again failure

Details: I've tried to start KEDR using default configuration and kedr_sample_target.ko:

1. sudo kedr start kedr_sample_target.ko
starting KEDR...
KEDR started.
2. sh kedr_sample_target load
3. sh kedr_sample_target unload
4. sudo kedr stop
Stopping KEDR...
sed: can't read /tmp/kedr/control/start.conf: No such file or directory
KEDR stopped.
5. sudo kedr start kedr_sample_target.ko
Service already running. For stop it call '/usr/local/bin/kedr stop'

So, I cannot start the KEDR again.

Comment:
KEDR control system was revisited. We still cannot reproduce the problem. Closing.

Comment:
KEDR now uses /var/tmp instead of /tmp for these purposes. Please check if the problem persists.

Comment:
Couldn't reproduce this behavior. My output:

1. sudo kedr start kedr_sample_target.ko
starting KEDR...
KEDR started.
2. sudo sh kedr_sample_target load
3. sudo sh kedr_sample_target unload
4. sudo kedr stop
Stopping KEDR...
KEDR stopped.
5. sudo kedr start kedr_sample_target.ko
starting KEDR...
KEDR started.

According to the submitting output, stopping KEDR (4-th step) was failed - 'kedr stop' script couldn't read file, which it had created at 'kedr start' call.

"KEDR stopped." was incorrect message after this step.

But cause, why '/tmp/kedr/control/start.conf' file is not exist, is unclear.
May be, there is a daemon, which clears '/tmp' directory periodically.

Message-ID: <201102241504.p1OF4F3e024810@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #17955, was updated on 2011-Feb-24 18:04

Summary: Support 'caller_address' even if stack traces are unreliable

Details: We should revisit the code that makes 'caller_address' variable available for usage in fault simulation scenarios. 

Currently, this mechanism relies on stack trace support, at least 2 reliable stack frames are needed. 

On some systems, however, stack traces obtained with dump_trace()/save_stack_trace() are not reliable, Debian 6 is an example. For now, we automatically disable support for 'caller_address' on such systems. We should make it possible to use 'caller_address' even there. At least one stack frame is still reliable there (we obtain it via GCC built-in).

Closing, because status quo seems to have been acceptable so far.

Current strategy of naming header files is:

'kedr/<component_name>/<header_file_name>.h'

where 
'kedr' - domain name, which coincides with program name, 
<component_name> -  name of kedr-component, which ships 
given header file,
<header_file_name> - short name of header file, which describe 
meaning of this header file.

<kedr/fault_simulation/fault_simulation.h>

 follows precisely to the above conventions.


Now 'kedr/fault_simulation' headers directory contains only 
'fault_simulation.h' and 'calculator.h' headers.

'fsim_*.h' headers was deleted as architecture of fault simulation 
has changed.

Note, that names of some headers are rough at this stage of 
project development.
