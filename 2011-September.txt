Subject: [Kedr-devel] [Bug #18346] Intercept the implementation of kfree_rcu
Message-ID: <201109081342.p88DgNUO014963@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #18346, was updated on 2011-Sep-08 17:42
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: KEDR
Category: Payload modules (plugins)
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: None
Priority: 5
Submitted by: euspectre
Assigned to : euspectre
Summary: Intercept the implementation of kfree_rcu

Details: LeakCheck should handle kfree_rcu() (appeared in version 3.0 of the kernel). For the present, it does not and therefore gives false positives.

N.B. kfree_rcu() is actually a macro, so we need to track whatever it unwraps to at the binary level.

Subject: [Kedr-devel] [Bug #18008] (Fixed in Hg) LeakCheck needs to
	intercept more functions
Message-ID: <201109231225.p8NCPheh029988@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #18008, was updated on 2011-Mar-18 16:19

Status: Open
Resolution: None

Summary: (Fixed in Hg) LeakCheck needs to intercept more functions

Details: 'nfs' kernel module uses at least next functions, which internally call alloc/free-like functions:

add_to_page_cache ~ free
posix_acl_from_mode ~ alloc
match_strdup ~ alloc

Without interception and making model of these functions, leak checker cannot produce correct verdict about memory allocations/deallocation.
