Subject: [Kedr-devel] [Bug #17591] different binary and source version of
	the linux kernel
Message-ID: <201011082201.oA8M1L3Z024206@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #17591, was updated on 2010-Oct-11 17:27
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: KEDR
Category: Build & Install
Status: Closed
Resolution: Later

Summary: different binary and source version of the linux kernel

Details: The binary version of my linux kernel is 2.6.31.5-0.1-desktop (uname -r output), but the version of installed kernel sources is 2.6.31.14-0.1. So, the example ./share/kedr/examples/sample_target/ cannot be built because of the following errors:

make: *** /lib/modules/2.6.31.5-0.1-desktop/build: No such file or directory.  Stop.

My system has /usr/src/linux-2.6.31.14-0.1 directory instead of /lib/modules/2.6.31.5-0.1-desktop and is not provide lower versions of kernel sources in the official software repository.

Comment:
By default, KEDR is built  against version of the kernel, which is currently running. User should provide by himself existence of infrastructure for build kernel modules in '/lib/modules/<current-kernel-version>/build'.

Possibility to build KEDR against arbitrary kernel version is introduce now in experimental mode. For use it, one should set KBUILD_VERSION_STRING cmake-variable to the version of the preferred kernel when configuring KEDR.
Again, infrastructure for build kernel modules should be accessible via '/lib/modules/<kernel-version>/build'.

Summary: Make the sources comply with Linux kernel coding style

Details: We should make sure that the sources of KEDR framework comply with coding standards used in the Linux kernel itself and approved by kernel.org specialists.

This is not critical but it could make adoption of KEDR a bit easier for those developers although it is not intended to try to get KEDR into the kernel right now.

checkpatch.pl and whatever other tools used to check the coding style of kernel patches could be used to do this.

Summary: Issues with parallel make

Details: With alias make='make -j2', kedr build fails with the following log:

Generating base.c
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `base/Module.symvers', needed by `controller/kedr_controller.ko'.  Stop.

If I now call 'make' once more, the build continues and finishes successfully.

Comment:
Yes, this is a known issue, see http://openfacts2.berlios.de/wikien/index.php/KEDR_Known_Issues

We will fix it in the future versions of KEDR.
