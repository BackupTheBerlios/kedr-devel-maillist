Summary: Issues with parallel make => Fixed in KEDR 0.2

Details: With alias make='make -j2', kedr build fails with the following log:

Scanning dependencies of target kedr_base
[  0%] Scanning dependencies of target kedr_controller
Generating base.c
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `base/Module.symvers', needed by `controller/kedr_controller.ko'.  Stop. 
make[1]: *** [controller/CMakeFiles/kedr_controller.dir/all] Error 2
make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
[  0%] Generating kedr_base.ko, Module.symvers
make[3]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.
[  3%] Built target kedr_base
make: *** [all] Error 2

If I now call 'make' once more, the build continues and finishes successfully.

Message-ID: <201103181319.p2IDJH7Q022584@unicorn.berlios.de>

Bug #18008, was updated on 2011-Mar-18 05:19

Status: Open

Summary: Leak checker need to intercept more functions

Details: 'nfs' kernel module uses at least next functions, which internally call alloc/free-like functions:

add_to_page_cache ~ free
posix_acl_from_mode ~ alloc
match_strdup ~ alloc

Without interception and making model of these functions, leak checker cannot produce correct verdict about memory allocations/deallocation.
